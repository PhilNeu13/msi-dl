    "# Small Language Models\n",
    "This notebook explores several neural network architectures for language modeling tasks. The models are trained on an artificially generated language. To the task remains the same. To predict the probability of the next word $Y$ given the previous words $X$ in a sentence.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Background and Motivation\n",
    "Training language models on real-world language data often requires extensive computational resources typically found in data centers. To explore the fundamental concepts of language modeling in a more accessible manner, we will use an artificially constructed language. This approach allows us to control complexity, understand the underlying mechanics, and ensure resource efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Understand, implement, and compare different neural network architectures (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) in language modeling tasks using an artificially generated language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "1. **Artificial Language Generation for Training**: Generate an initial dataset of sentences using a simple, rule-based grammar (see below).\n",
    "2. **Tokenization**: Convert these sentences into sequences of integers.\n",
    "3. **Model Building**: Implement at least the first 3 models - a basic RNN (required), an LSTM (required), 1DCNN (required) and a Transformer (optional)\n",
    "4. **Training**: Train each model on the artificial language dataset and evaluate the performance of each model while training on the validation set by showing the learning curves for each model and comparing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the starter code provided below to get started. Feel free to modify the code as you see fit. The architecture of the models is up to you but can be simple. For example for the RNN it might look like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "Important is to choose an appropriate loss function for the next predicted token. In the above example, the vocabulary size is 25."
